Copy ShortURL Add-on
====================

by Fred Wenzel ``<fwenzel@mozilla.com>``

On any webpage, you get a new item in the right click menu called “copy
short URL”. When you click it, the add-on looks for a canonical short URL
exposed in the page header. Currently, a number of major websites
expose their own short URLs for any entry on their webpages, among these:

* youtube (“youtu.be/…”),
* flickr (“flic.kr/…”),
* Arstechnica,
* Techcrunch,

and many more.

If, however, the site does not name its own short URL, the add-on
automatically falls back to making a short URL using tinyurl.com.

Either way, after a fraction of a second, you end up with a short URL in your
clipboard, ready to be used in forum posts, tweets, or wherever else you
please.
